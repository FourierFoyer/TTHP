  <h2>The Lumpley Void</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      Taking from
      <a href='http://lumpley.com/index.php/anyway/thread/119'>Lumpley</a>
      , my first mission as a designer of a new TTRPG is to answer just one solitary question:</br>
      What's in the void?</br>
	  </br>
      This void is <i>the</i> game, if the game is well designed. Everything in the game
      should be in service to the void, and nothing should be included in the game that
      does not in some way, some how, operate in service to that void.</br>
      </br>
      Why is it a "void" and not a "thing" of some sort, like a rule or a score? Because
      a game designer cannot, can never, dictate how a game will feel. He can create
      rules, write instructions, maybe write code if it's a virtual game, .. but the
      concept of "fun" cannot be implemented right there in the rules (at least, not
      until we find a way to trigger our dopamine systems directly, putting aside the
      pharmaceutical options). The fun of tennis is not the score. The fun of an arcade
      game is not the score. The fun is challenging yourself, and challenging the
      people you're playing with.
    </p>
	<p>
      I believe I've done enough research to confidently answer the question, though this
      will turn out to be only part of the answer. So what's in the void for the tabletop
      hero project? AFFIRMATION OF IDENTITY.
    </p>
    <p>
      To paraphrase the final argument of Richard Bartle's
      <a href='https://mud.co.uk/richard/VWWPP.pdf'>
        Virtual Worlds: Why People Play
      </a>,
      pleasure is derived from a combination of player development along the stages
      of learning, e.g. through the
      <a href='https://www.businessballs.com/self-awareness/conscious-competence-learning-model/'>
        Conscious Competence Learning Model
      </a>,
      and immersion within and mastery of the virtual world. The player becomes his
      best self, and proves it by becoming skilled and powerful within the virtual
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, however, is not quite enough, as I'm seeking a subtle variation. What
      I'm seeking is, in fact: AFFIRMATION OF GROUP IDENTITY.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hero's Journey, or Monomyth, is a good enough model for a <i>story</i>,
      either a written book, a movie, a stageplay, or a told tale. There is a
      single hero progressing through his or her own journey, and the hero
      comes out of the adventure as a better being. That's all well and good,
      but when you get four players gathered together at a table together, a
      single one of them shouldn't be the "hero" by himself.
    </p>

  <br />
  <p>Quoting Ron Edwards: "As an example, in My Life with Master: Fear, Reason,
    Love, Weariness, and Self-Loathing are quantified. However, "defiance" and
    "self-worth" are not. Similarly, although "More than human" and "Less than
    human" are verbally defined for each character, basic "Human" is not."
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    If "AFFIRMATION OF GROUP IDENTITY" is the relationship I want to model in
    the fruitful void, what scaffolding will lead players to this void, or
    encourage them to develop it on their own? This is not such an easily
    answered question. However, I can look at the layer below it: the Bartle
    Ladder for each player. Every player will go through the same four stages
    in their journey:<br />
    <ol>
      <li><b>Seeker</b> phase: The player is either a Griefer (Implicit Killer) or
        an Opportunist (Implicit Achiever). The player is looking for ways to
        test himself and measures that succees either by literal combat victory
        or else by the standard currency of achievement set up by the game
        designers, e.g. gold, XP, score.</li>
      <li><b>Learner</b> phase: The player is a Networker (Explicit Socializer) or
        an Scientist (Explicit Explorer). The player has spent enough time mucking
        about and now seeks a purpose. He can operate in the world and among its
        citizens, but he must now answer: to what end?</li>
      <li><b>Doer</b> phase: The player is either a Politician (Explicit Killer)
        or Planner (Explicit Achiever). Having chosen or inferred a goal either in
        the world or relative to its citizens, the player seeks now to tactically
        navigate towards it, climbing the mountain of either respect or of
        achievement, which may involve several smaller victories.</li>
      <li><b>Master</b> phase: The player is either a Friend (Implicit Socializer)
        or Hacker (Implicit Explorer). Having summitted the mountain, the player
        no longer seeks to climb but visit the world only to socialize with the
        circle of friends acquired along the way or to once again muck about in
        world, this time not to learn how to operate within in, but to test its
        boundaries and limits.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    The nature of the Seeker phase suggests statistics fairly immediately, but I'm
    more interested in the later phases. If the fruitful void is about the Bartle
    Ladder, then the Bartle Ladder is about phase 3 especially. How to track
    players' hill-climbing success? My first thought is that it must be about the
    "war" bot the "battle", i.e. rewards after every single encounter are <i>counter
    productive</i> because it encourages players to try and "win" every single one.
  </p>
  <p>
    Scratch that: a per-battle will work for phase 1 since it will encourage players
    to learn the system. However it should be in tandem wuth rewards for Opportunists,
    the other Seekers, so combat victory is not the only way to "win". This kind of
    reward system should discontinue after phase 1.
  </p>
  <h2>Another Idea</h2>
  Inspired by The Game of D&amp;D<a href='https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ-ehbVQYxI'>https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ-ehbVQYxI</a>, have the defenders allow to choose defence method during an attack.
