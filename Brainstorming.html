  <h2>The Lumpley Void</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      Taking from
      <a href='http://lumpley.com/index.php/anyway/thread/119'>Lumpley</a>
      , my first mission as a designer of a new TTRPG is to answer just one solitary question:</br>
      What's in the void?</br>
	  </br>
      This void is <i>the</i> game, if the game is well designed. Everything in the game
      should be in service to the void, and nothing should be included in the game that
      does not in some way, some how, operate in service to that void.</br>
      </br>
      Why is it a "void" and not a "thing" of some sort, like a rule or a score? Because
      a game designer cannot, can never, dictate how a game will feel. He can create
      rules, write instructions, maybe write code if it's a virtual game, .. but the
      concept of "fun" cannot be implemented right there in the rules (at least, not
      until we find a way to trigger our dopamine systems directly, putting aside the
      pharmaceutical options). The fun of tennis is not the score. The fun of an arcade
      game is not the score. The fun is challenging yourself, and challenging the
      people you're playing with.
    </p>
	<p>
      I believe I've done enough research to confidently answer the question, though this
      will turn out to be only part of the answer. So what's in the void for the tabletop
      hero project? AFFIRMATION OF IDENTITY.
    </p>
    <p>
      To paraphrase the final argument of Richard Bartle's
      <a href='https://mud.co.uk/richard/VWWPP.pdf'>
        Virtual Worlds: Why People Play
      </a>,
      pleasure is derived from a combination of player development along the stages
      of learning, e.g. through the
      <a href='https://www.businessballs.com/self-awareness/conscious-competence-learning-model/'>
        Conscious Competence Learning Model
      </a>,
      and immersion within and mastery of the virtual world. The player becomes his
      best self, and proves it by becoming skilled and powerful within the virtual
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, however, is not quite enough, as I'm seeking a subtle variation. What
      I'm seeking is, in fact: AFFIRMATION OF GROUP IDENTITY.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hero's Journey, or Monomyth, is a good enough model for a <i>story</i>,
      either a written book, a movie, a stageplay, or a told tale. There is a
      single hero progressing through his or her own journey, and the hero
      comes out of the adventure as a better being. That's all well and good,
      but when you get four players gathered together at a table together, a
      single one of them shouldn't be the "hero" by himself.

  <br />
  <p>Quoting Ron Edwards: "As an example, in My Life with Master: Fear, Reason,
    Love, Weariness, and Self-Loathing are quantified. However, "defiance" and
    "self-worth" are not. Similarly, although "More than human" and "Less than
    human" are verbally defined for each character, basic "Human" is not."
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    If "AFFIRMATION OF GROUP IDENTITY" is the relationship I want to model in
    the fruitful void, what stats are quantified and what stats are not? As a
    very rough first try, the UNNAMED BUT CRITICAL STATS ARE:<br />
    <ul>
      <li>cooperation - important because I want the group to, at the end of the day, cooperate better rather than worse. If the group cannot cooperate as PCs, then they are adversarial. Adversarialism is great for SOME games, but these must be fundamentally different games. It is also not sufficient to measure cooperation by combat-success. Combat does not necessarily measure cooperation. It only measures individual PC survivability and DPS, damage per second (or per round).</li>
      <li>character identity - important because I also don't want the
        characters' unique identities to be subsumed by the group. More than that, I want the game to be ABOUT those specific characters, so that they flavour the game instead of just being the baloney you wade through to get to the stats.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    This creates an internal conflict right there at the VERY HEART of the game: players' drive to let the character be themself while at the same time, struggling to be not so divergent as to be uncooperative and ruin this other aspect of the game.
    <br />
    The game, then, is at its FIRST STAGE finding the comfy equilibrium
    between each characters' identity and yet being able to put aside their
    differences to become an effective team.<br />
    <br />
    This leads the game to a SECOND STAGE, finding other ways for the team
    to work together, for different scenarios and facing different
    obstacles. Ideally, the challenges should vary slowly, one at a time,
    to allow the chance for the team to adapt. Then the challenges begin
    to stack up, requiring the PCs to change between behaviours as
    required.<br />
    <br />
    The FINAL STAGE is the BBEG (though it need not be personified), where
    the players are required to use every tool in their kit, to work
    together and stay alive, eventually defeating the BBEG thanks to their
    efficient teamwork.<br />
    <br />
    Lastly there is a DENOUEMENT STAGE. The BBEG is defeated and the PCs
    must escape, using their cooperative abilities to get out of dodge
    and back to civilized society.
    <br />
    <br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Even though it was a rough first try, I quite like the idea of the two
    unnamed stats being "COOPERATION" versus "CHARACTER IDENTITY". The
    "AFFIRMATION OF GROUP IDENTITY" would come through as the PCs help
    each other resolve their own coop-VS-ci conflicts. This requires the
    conflict for an individual character is NOT SOLVABLE by the character
    themself, firstly, and that the PCs are capable of helping each other
    solve (or at least indefinitely manage) their respective conflicts.
  </p>
  <p>
    How to pull this off? First we need to know the consequence for
    failure to resolve the coop-VS-ci conflicts. I don't think this should
    be a single one-size-fits-all consequence. The players should define
    the consequence for each of their characters. E.g.<br />
    <ul>
      <li>Catburglar Rogue - Descends fully into a life of crime. Caught by law enforcement. Caught by parties he stole from, possibly other thieves.</li>
      <li>Bookish Arcane Wizard - Can't resist the temptation of the library. Hired as a court wizard. Attracted to a research project and leaves the group.</li>
      <li>Angry Violent Barbarian - Kills an innocent, flies into depression. Caught by law enforcement. Killed during combat due to lack of control.</li>
      <li>Music-loving Bard - Becomes a gambling addict. Attracted to family-life by a fan. Hired as a court bard.</li>
      <li>Happy-go-lucky Assassin - Accidentally kills the wrong target. Caught by law enforcement. Killed by competing assassin guild.</li>
      <li>World-weary Paladin - Retires. Ascends to a godly realm. Finally takes a desk job.</li>
      <li>Family-dead Soldier - Meets someone he can finally fall in love with. Becomes at peace with the loss. Kills the culprit who murdered them.</li>
      <li>Oddball Sorcerer - Blows themselves up in a fireball. Ascends to a godly realm. Learns a megaspell that solves the universe and transports them forever to the beyond.</li>
      <li>Wanderlusting Druid - Decides to leave the group and be on his own in nature. Becomes a tree. Is recruited by a Druidic Order, permanently.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's call this their IDENTITY DOOM. It is the doom they
    face when they fully embrace their own natures.</p>
  <p>
    Some of these fates are better or worse, but in all cases, they wholly
    remove the character from the game. Therefore, this ought to be avoided
    while a campaign is ongoing. However, cooperation shouldn't be so easy
    a choice either. Playing to their identity should also have an
    attractive benefit, and the PLAYER will always be having to make a
    tough decision between:<br />
    <ol>
      <li>Satisfying their identity - because if the character doesn't, they edge closer to their IDENTITY DOOM, but they also get an IDENTITY BOON.</li>
      <li>Being a "good" team member (whatever that means) - because if the character doesn't, ??? OH HOW ABOUT THEY NEED IT TO RISE IN LEVEL! NO COOPERATE, NO LEVELS</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, is that boring? Like having to choose between an endless purgatory (no levels) versus restraining oneself from having fun (no identity-based special moves). Maybe I'm missing the point altogether by statting what's supposed to be a numberless stat, i.e. the void. </p>
  <p>
    This is the missing piece at the center of the puzzle that I think will
    hold it all together. Maybe a COOPERATION BOON? Something that is of
    equal benefit to their IDENTITY BOON but can only be applied to another
    party member? These can be more vanilla, maybe with a table of
    acceptable boons in the Player's Handbook.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is not bad, but I'm not certain this will encourage the PLAYERS to
    have to fight their own natural temptation to succumb to the IDENTITY
    DOOM, while at the same time being drawn to defeat the so-called
    darkness by taking advantage of the COOPERATION BOON, and further to
    go above-and-beyond to not just function as a team, but to totally
    kick ass.
  </p>
  <p>
    Maybe there are STAGES, or PHASES, that they as a team can climb.
    Failure of a character at phase 1 leads to the Worst IDENTITY DOOM.
    Jail. Desk job. Assassination. Wandering away and getting lost forever.
    Failure of a character at phase 2 leads to a not-so-bad DOOM.
    Recruitment in a guild. Retirement. Becoming a tree.

  Inspired by The Game of D&amp;D<a href='https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ-ehbVQYxI'>https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ-ehbVQYxI</a>, have the defenders allow to choose defence method during an attack.
